# Running the tests

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install gulp -g
npm install
```

Now run `gulp` and it will run the tests and linting. You can also run `gulp watch` to watch for any changes.

# Testing the webpage

An easy way is to run it through something like the PHP built in web server:

```bash
cd public
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then browse to [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html).
